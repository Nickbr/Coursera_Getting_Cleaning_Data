# Code Book

## Applies To

`tidy.txt` 

## Desription

This code book defines the data fields in the tidy data set created by the R file run_analysis.R. The data can be created from the source by  executing the R script, or can be found in the repo file `tidy.txt`. See README.md for a full description of the source data used to create the tidy data set

## Key Values

The dataset contains 2 key values, listed below

* `subject` - The ID of the test subject that the record relates to
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken. 

## Activity Labels

The activiy labels in the tidy data set are strings, but in the original data they are key values with a foriegn key relationship to those values. The relationship is shown below

* `WALKING` (value `1`): subject was walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value `2`): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value `3`): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` (value `4`): subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING` (value `5`): subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING` (value `6`): subject was laying down during the test

## Measurements

The features selected for the source come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

The clean dataset contains the mean values of all features ordered by activity name and subject id.

The dataset is made up of the following values. For a description of the values, see the source data set README.txt and features_info.txt files
